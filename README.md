# CS-437-IoT-Project: Pet Tracker in the House

### Introduction:

This project can track people's pets in their homes on the level of rooms. People can know the rooms their pets are currently located using a phone application. 
Therefore, this application help people find their pets in their house. This application can be useful when looking for pets in a big house with a lot of rooms.

Besides, people can obtain information including the time their pets spend in each room, and the best buddy of their pets (other pet or human that this pet spends the most time with) if they have multiple pets or they would like to participate in tracking using their own phones. 
The application provides visualization like heatmaps to help people better understand their pets' behaviors. 

The technology we use is Bluetooth. Users have to attach special collar to their pets and install devices in each room. 

This application can also be used on any items in the house like keys and wallet. 

If our pets are lost in the wild, it is possible that other people who use our application will find our pets. So an advanced version of our application might be Airtags.
